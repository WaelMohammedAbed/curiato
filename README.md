Technical test

1) Convert the API C# (mattressdevice.cs file) into a Python or Node.js script to run in a Linux environment.  Donâ€™t convert the code to use the API with the SDK. Please ONLY convert the code for using the API without the SDK as the SDK will not be running on the raspberry pi. 

We will run the code you create on the raspberry pi and see if we can pull from the sensor mat with the appropriate mmHg value, x, y, and timestamp. 

2) Parse the attached excel and store it into a database.
1- Parse each line into 48 rows (split the line each having 24 fields).
2- Store the data a database.
3- Retrieve data as x, y and z. the variable z is for the data and x and y value should represent the row and column.
